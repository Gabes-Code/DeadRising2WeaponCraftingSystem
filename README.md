# DeadRising2WeaponCraftingSystem
Building a system similar to the Dead Rising 2 combo weapon system within Unity using C# and ScriptableObjects


The system will be implemented using the starter assets third person controller, and custom weapons created within blender. Player will interact with a work bench, placing 2 weapons on the bench and if both items are ingredients in a recipe, the crafted weapon will be instantiated.
